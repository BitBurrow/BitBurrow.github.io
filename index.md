# How to set up your own BitBurrow VPN server

## THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT EXIST YET

Everything below is proposed draft documentation. The software to do what is described is being developed and is not at all usable yet.

## Introduction

BitBurrow is a set of tools to help you set up and use a VPN server anywhere--at your parents' house, an office, or a friend's apartment. And you don't have to be good with computers. A BitBurrow VPN server will allow you to securely use the internet from anywhere in the world as if you were at your "VPN home".
